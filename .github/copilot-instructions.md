We use Maven for managing our Java dependencies, not Maven.
Always first exmplain me the solution before writing the code.
Write code only after my approval.
Always write code in small steps.
This project uses Java 21, so make sure to use the correct version.
If you need to use a library, first check if it is available in the Maven Central Repository
and if it is not, ask me for approval before using it.
after writing the code add the changelog entry in the `README.md` file
when implementing a new feature, always make sure to follow the existing code style and patterns.
Follow exisitng code structure and organization.
Make sure to add dependencies to the parent pom.xml file for version mangement.
If you need to add a new dependency, first check if it is already defined in the parent
pom.xml file, if it is not, ask me for approval before adding it.
Always make sure to add chat conversation to the saga_orchestrator_service_build.md file following the existing format after each conversation  so that I can continue the build process later
Make sure to user latest Java 21 features and best practices.
