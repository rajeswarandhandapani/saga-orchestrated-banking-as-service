**Instructions for Code Generation and Contribution**

1. We use Maven for managing Java dependencies.
2. Always explain your solution before writing any code.
3. Write code only after receiving my approval.
4. Implement code in very small and incremental steps.
5. Ensure all code is compatible with Java 21 and uses its latest features and best practices.
6. Before using a library, verify that it is available in the Maven Central Repository. If it is not, request my approval before proceeding.
7. When implementing new features, always follow the existing code style, structure, and patterns.
8. Add new dependencies to the parent `pom.xml` file for version management.
9. Before adding a new dependency, check if it is already defined in the parent `pom.xml`. If not, ask for my approval before adding it.
10. Keep the code simple, readable, and only generate what is necessary for the feature.
11. Use Lombok annotations to reduce boilerplate code.
12. Don't over-engineer solutions; keep them straightforward and maintainable.
